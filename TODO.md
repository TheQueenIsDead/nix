# TODO

A list of things I'd like to achieve in Nix

 - [ ] Install on my laptop and configure a profile based off of the same flake
 - [ ] Configure [nh](https://github.com/nix-community/nh) to auto clean configurations
 - [ ] Attempt to specify docker contaienrs via nix configurations to enable workers on my dev machine and server.
 - [ ] Give Hyprland a go and get ricing
 - [ ] Setup Steam for some light gaming
 - [ ] Configure SSH and GPG key setup in a system keychain & git credential helper
 - [ ] Setup CI to standardise nix file formatting with [nixmft](https://github.com/NixOS/nixfmt)
 - [ ] Attempt to verify Nix config installability in CI ([Possible?](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/install-nix))
